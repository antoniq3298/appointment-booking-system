A lightweight web-based appointment booking system for small service businesses.  
Clients book services into predefined time slots. Admin manages services, slots, and bookings.

## Features

### Client
- Register / Login
- Forgot / reset password (emailed link, 1h expiry)
- Edit profile (name, phone) and change password
- View active services
- Select a date and see available slots per employee
- Create booking (conflict-safe, per employee)
- Email + SMS booking confirmation, cancellation email, 24h-before SMS reminder
- View own bookings (with assigned employee)
- Cancel own booking (blocked within 12h of the appointment)

### Admin
- One-time admin bootstrap (demo)
- Add / disable services
- Add / disable employees
- Configure a shared weekly working schedule (hours per weekday)
- Configure closed dates / vacation periods (blocks booking + slot generation)
- Generate slots for a date + employee (work range + interval), or bulk-generate from the weekly schedule for every active employee
- View all bookings (with client, employee, service)
- Cancel or delete any booking

## Setup & Run (Windows / PowerShell)

1) Install dependencies
```powershell
cd backend
npm install
Start server
node server.js
Open in browser

App: http://localhost:3000

Health check: http://localhost:3000/api/health

First-Time Demo Flow
1) Create admin (one-time)

Open: http://localhost:3000
Fill the “Admin bootstrap” form and create an admin user.

2) Admin actions

Open: http://localhost:3000/admin.html

Add a service

Generate slots (date + from/to + interval)

Refresh bookings list

Open: http://localhost:3000/register.html

Register as client

Go to booking page

Select date, pick slot, reserve

Check “My bookings”

Cancel booking (optional)

Booking Rules & Data Integrity

A slot is offered only when:

slots.is_active = 1

there is no booking with status = 'booked' for that slot

Booking conflicts are prevented server-side:

if two clients try the same slot, the second request returns 409 SLOT_ALREADY_BOOKED

Notes on npm audit

npm audit can report vulnerabilities from transitive dependencies.
For this academic scope (local demo), stability is prioritized. Avoid npm audit fix --force during development unless you plan to re-test all dependencies.
